        <h3>
            Few features for the front end of this website, all need to be complete <b>this sprint</b>:
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Create search bar</li>
            <li>Create a spot to upload files (drag and drop style></li>
            <li>If necessary, create a nav bar for all endpoints</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Goals for this sprint:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A search bar that validates user input, and breaks down search into relevant keywords (all in the frontend)
            </li>
            <li>
                An upload function that allows user to upload multiple files of only type .cpp
            </li>
            <li>
                Create error and success cards that are displayed to user, notifying any updates from the webapp
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Format of this application:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                There are seperate folders for any css and js files you would like to add. If you would like to add files, make sure to add them to the index.html as well
            </li>
            <li>
                The majority of formatting and styling is done by bootstrap (currently pointing to a cdn). The primary reason is for ease of responsive and clean design
            </li>
        </ul>
